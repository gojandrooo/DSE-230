    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "Our company (Spotify) would like to dynamically target advertising to non-premium members based on their physical activity while using Spotify services. For example, while a listener is enjoying a podcast and folding their laundry, they would receive an ad for laundry detergent. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition Spotify also wishes to cater to our premium members by enhancing music recommendation/auto-play options based on a members physical activity. For example, while a user is exercising play up-tempo music, and while a user is eating pasta play Italian classics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Accelerometer (measures proper acceleration) and Gyroscope (measures orientation and angular velocity) data was collected from 51 volunteer subjects. Each subject was asked to perform 18 tasks for 3 minutes each. The 18 tasks were a mix of physical activities that could be distinctly identified, such as walking, eating, laundry, etc. We (Spotify) tried to collect data for activities that our members might be doing while using our services. The tasks are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image info](./images/Activity-Code-Table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each subject had a smartwatch placed on his/her dominant hand and a smartphone in their pocket. The smartphone and smartwatch both had an accelerometer and gyrocope, yielding four total sensors (Phone - Gyroscope, Phone - Accelerometer, Watch - Gyroscope, Watch - Accelerometer).\n",
    "\n",
    "![image info](./images/Human-With-Sensors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomodate the four sensors, the data is split up into 4 subdirectories, one for each device and sensor. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image info](./images/Sensor-Subdirectories.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each directory contains the sensor results for the 51 subject's performance of the 18 activities. The results for each subject are stored in a comma delimited text file. Since there are 51 subjects and 4 different sensors, there are a total of 204 text files. Each text file has the same six attributes: Subject-id, Activity Code, Timestamp, x, y, z\n",

We stuck with dask so we could use the natural integration it has with python, as well as its similiar syntax to Pandas.\n",
